# Overview

I want to build a thorough, well thought out, and quality Ruby SDK for the
Tenable API. This will allow developers to build tool to interact with
Tenable in a programmatic fashion. The SDK for the API should handle the
heavy lifting such as storing the token on disk encrypted, authentication,
and other items to make it easy for developers to build tools.

## Focus

- Vulnerability Management
- Web App Scanning
